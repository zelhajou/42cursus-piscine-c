
- Memory allocation is the process of reserving a portion of memory for specific use.
- In programming, memory allocation is often categorized into two types:
    - **Static Allocation:** Memory is allocated at compile-time and remains fixed during program execution. This is common for variables with a fixed size.
    - **Dynamic Allocation:** Memory is allocated at runtime as needed and can change during program execution. This is used for data structures like arrays and objects whose size may vary.


When we execute a C Program, it requires to reserve some memory in the machine to store its variables, functions, instructions and the program file itself. However, we also have a memory segment that we can use dynamically as much memory as the system have and that too during the run-time of a program. So, now let us see the components/segments of memory that are used during the execution of a C program.
