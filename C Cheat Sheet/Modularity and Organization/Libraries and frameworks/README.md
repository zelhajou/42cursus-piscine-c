# Libraries and frameworks

Libraries and frameworks are fundamental components in software development that help streamline the development process, provide pre-written code, and offer solutions to common programming challenges.


Libraries have two roles which illustrate Abstraction
- Allow programmers to reuse commonly accessed code.
- Act as block box implementing functionality for the programmer.

### C Libraries:

- The standard library of a Unix platform is generically referred to as <ins>libc</ins>. it provides the basic interface to the system: fundamental calls such as ``read()``, `write()` and ``printf()``. this API is described in its entirety by a specification called POSIX. it is freely available  online and describes the many calls that make up the standard Unix API

- **Standard C Library:** C has a standard library that provides a set of functions for performing essential tasks such as input/output operations, string manipulation, memory management, and more. It includes headers like `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`, and `<string.h>`.
- **External Libraries:** C programmers often use external libraries to extend the language's capabilities. Some common external C libraries include:
    
    - **OpenGL:** A graphics library for rendering 2D and 3D graphics.
    - **SQLite:** A lightweight database library.
    - **SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer):** A cross-platform development library designed for multimedia applications.
